# ErrHandlerGo

Error handling utilities written in 'golang', the Go Programming Language.

#### SpecErr - Error Handler
Type 'SpecErr' located in source code file errutility.go is designed
to process fatal errors, standard errors, information messages, debug
messages and warning messages.

'SpecErr' has been deprecated and is only maintained for backwards
compatibility. For new development, the use of 'OpsMsgDto' is
recommended.  

#### OpsMsgDto - Operations Message Handler
Type 'OpsMsgDto' located in source code file opsmsgdto.go is designed
to manage information, debug, error, fatal error and warning messages.

'OpsMsgDto' supersedes the 'SpecErr' type and is recommended for use in 
new development projects.  

#### Source Code Repository
The source code for these types is maintained at:
